virtual-GPIO
============

Arduino as a "GPIO" device attached to PC or Raspberry Pi, which run python control script.

Give your Raspberry Pi precise counters, easy IR receiver, analog inputs.
Give your PC a virtual GPIO on a USB port. Add SPI, I2C, analog & digital pins, servo control, etc.

Supported:
  - GPIO digital in/out  D2-D13  A0-A5
  - PWM out  8bit - 6 pins
  - high performance PWM option, or as pulse generator 1Hz to 1MHz
  - analog Read  10bit  8 pins
  - SPI master, multiple choice for CE pin
  - pulseout 1-250 uSec [arduino coded]
  - pulsein   0-25 mSec [arduino coded, not native arduino version]
  - servo    pins3-10
  - ir remote rx
  - SMBus / I2C master
  - 2 software (arduino-polled) counters / quadEncoders
  - Hardware pin counter x 1 on d5
  - Twin INT0/INT1 counters on d2/d3
  - AVR raw register access
  - Auto-find for PC end serial port

Generally about 800 instructions/sec achievable on PC, depending on call type, and 200/sec on rPi.

"virtGPIO.py" is the PC end of "virtual-gpio", ie using arduino as a GPIO device on PC (python on linux).
This module uses USB serial to power and control the arduino.

The ARDUINO end is the sketch "VirtGPIO.ino".
Shields, attached modules etc are NOT generally coded at the arduino end. Such support is to be coded at the PC end.
(Exceptions:  infrared remote codes reader, and background stepper)
Atmega328 is assumed.

Main files:
  - VirtGPIO.ino (and its acompanying library files) essential - sketch for Arduino end.
  - virtGPIO.py essential library at Raspberry Pi or PC.
  - collection of example python files demonstrating use of virtual GPIO.

Changes made V0.9 -> v0.9.5  :
Added serialConfig.py for port settings
Sonar removed from virtGPIO core, out to simple example script
SPI devices get individual control of mode
i2c - option to disable arduino's internal pullups
SPI.xfer2() out to 80 chars, and added unlimited SPI.writebytes()
Improved RPI syntax compatibility
Now Python 2.7 / Python 3.3 compatible


V0.9.5
November 2014
