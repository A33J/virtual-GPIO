This set of files should ALL exist in the folder .../sketchbook/VirtGPIO/
They are the files that compile to the VirtGPIO sketch for the arduino.
By having them all in the VirtGPIO project folder, 
they need no further libraries to be installed in standard place  .../sketchbook/libraries/

Further, these files are all tweaked a bit to work together for the VirtGPIO project.

You may STILL have equivalent libraries installed in your own arduino environment:
They should not interact with these tweaked versions.
